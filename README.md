# Sonic-Pi-Instrumentals
Short music pieces composed using Sonic Pi, a software for music making and learning how to code. 
All code is written in Ruby. In order to run it you need to download Sonic Pi: https://sonic-pi.net/

These pieces were composed as a fun experiment in music making. 
At FIT Coding Challenge 2017, a local programming competition, some of theme were performed live, making it
one if first (if not the first) live programming performances of this kind in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
